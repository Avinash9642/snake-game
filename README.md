 Our Snake Game Web Development Project is a delightful fusion of design, interactivity, and functionality. The web-based game encapsulates the classic Snake gameplay, where players navigate a pixelated snake through a grid, consuming food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the snake's own body and the game boundaries.
